# Guess-My-Number-Game

This is my first very basic project. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.
In this game a user has 20 guesses to guess a secret number. The game will give the user hint whether their current guess is too high or too low.

Once the guess is correct, the user wins.
